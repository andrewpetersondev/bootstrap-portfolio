## Take a look

**[Bootstrap Portfolio](https://andrewpetersondev.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/)**

The purpose of this project was to perfectly translate images into a website using bootstrap techniques.

### Criteria

- [x] Using Bootstrap, recreate my portfolio site with the following items:

  - [x]A navbar

  - [x] A responsive layout (bootstrap's grid is based on rows and columns)

  - [x] eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

  - [x] Responsive images

- [x] Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

- [x] Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

## Bonuses

- [x] Make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site.

## Status

In Progress.
